# LAQ-Fort
Encryption for the mighty.

LAQ-Fort (Lattice Authenticated Quantumn Fortress) is a ultra secure encryption algorithm that is quantum resistant. It is based on the Kyber lattice-based algorithm along with AES-256 encryption with a custom multiplier for amount of AES layers. LAQ-Fort also utilizes a fractal encryption method to further secure the data with a custom depth level. The algorithm is designed to be quantum resistant and secure against all known attacks.
